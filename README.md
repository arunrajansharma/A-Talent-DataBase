# A-Talent-DataBase
This project involved designing and implementing part of a database for keeping information about talent search shows. 
The implementation was done in three different ways : 
1. Flora - 2 :  an open source rule-based system for knowledge representation and reasoning. The language of the system is derived from F-logic, HiLog, and Transaction logic. Being based on F-logic and HiLog implies that object-oriented syntax and higher-order representation are the major features of the system.

2. object- relational extensions of SQL â€” whatever is supported by PostgreSQL. Using Java/JSP/Servlets to build an application front end to your database. Database connectivity should be done using Java/JDBC.

3. XQuery &amp; eXist-db : A query and functional programming language that queries and transforms collections of structured and unstructured data, usually in the form of XML, text and with vendor-specific extensions for other data formats (JSON, binary, etc.).
